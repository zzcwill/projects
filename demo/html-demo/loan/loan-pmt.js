 * @param rate_per_period       The interest rate for the loan.
 * @param number_of_payments    The total number of payments for the loan in months.
 * @param present_value         The present value, or the total amount that a series of future payments is worth now;
 *                              Also known as the principal.
 * @param future_value          The future value, or a cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made.
 *                              If fv is omitted, it is assumed to be 0 (zero), that is, the future value of a loan is 0.
 * @param type                  Optional, defaults to 0. The number 0 (zero) or 1 and indicates when payments are due.
 *                              0 = At the end of period
